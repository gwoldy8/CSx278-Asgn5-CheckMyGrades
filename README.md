# CSx278-Asgn5-CheckMyGrades

    After conducting interviews with three different students at Vanderbilt, it was clear that all of them shared similar complaints about the difficulty of checking grades on Brightspace. The site is cluttered with an unreasonable number of tabs and poor organization. Simply checking grades requires a series of clicks and does not show your actual class average or standing. They all expressed interest in a texting bot that returns your grades when you send it a message. With people spending so much time on their phones now, creating this option is a natural extension of the way the world is moving. 
    In terms of the functionality sought by the interviewees, the primary desire was for a method to retrieve recent grades. Additional features include filtering by class and update text notifications. Student 3 pointed out that part of the problem was the fault of professors, not necessarily with the web site itself, so this application will not end up fixing all the problems associated with keeping up with grades.
    Overall, the students surveyed found significant issues with the current system of checking grades on Brightspace. This new application will reply to a text message and return the most recent assignments in a particular class for a student. This will be the core function of the application, but other things such as returning the category of the assignment and the percentage of the grade that category is worth will also be implemented. 


# Questions:

2. How often do you check your grades?
3. How do you currently keep up with your grades in your classes?
4. Why do you keep up with your grades that way?
5. Would you text a bot that returned your grades on recent assignments?
6. When/Why would you use this over Brightspace?
7. Is there any additional information you would want that bot to return?
8. Would you like to have the option to specify which class you are searching in, or just have all recent grades returned?
9. Is a two-week history of grades enough or would you prefer the last ‘x’ number of assignments?
10. Would you like text notifications to be automatically sent to you?

# Answers:

## Question 1:
1. Brightspace is not good for seeing what your grades are. The gradebook is hard to navigate to and difficult to read when you do find it.
2. Very cluttered and has too many tabs.
3. Teachers take forever to post grades. I’d like to see my current average in different categories.


## Question 2:
1. Once a week I will probably check my gradebook.
2. I look whenever I see a notification, but I look at the gradebook every week or so.
3. Once a day.


## Question 3:
1. I do not consistently check my grades, but when I do, I generally look at my printed copy of a syllabus and check the physically returned papers.
2. Usually I set up an excel sheet with received grades and projections for my averages and future assignments.
3. I look at Brightspace and compute averages myself.


## Question 4:
1. I don’t really like the layout of Brightspace, and the colors are ugly.
2. I like to know how I am standing in the class.
3. I like to plan for the future.


## Question 5:
1. Yes, absolutely.
2. Probably not. I think checking my Brightspace would be just as quick.
3. Yes, I would.


## Question 6:
1. It gets straight to the point of what I want. Currently, I must make a series of clicks to get similar information on Brightspace.
2. If I get automatic messages I would use this over Brightspace.
3. If I am on my phone rather than a computer.


## Question 7:
1. Upcoming quizzes, tests, or assignments.
2. Notifications for future assignments.
3. Information for upcoming assignments.


## Question 8:
1. Yes, that sounds good.
2. Yes, having those options would be helpful.
3. I would like to have that option to specify the class.


## Question 9:
1. It depends on the class, but in general I think the latter option is better. Some courses have relatively few assignments, and I think the point of this would be to see how you are doing in the class right now.
2. I would rather have the ‘x’ number of assignments returned.
3. I would rather see my scores for the last ‘x’ number of assignments.


## Question 10:
1. I wouldn’t mind having that option, but I prefer being the one who initiates it.
2. Yes, that would probably be the main reason I would want this service to exist.
3. Yes, automatically would be ideal.
